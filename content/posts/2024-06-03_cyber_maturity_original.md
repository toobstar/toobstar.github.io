In a domain with significant uncertainty and complexity such as cybersecurity a common approach taken by organisations initially  is to ask where they stand compared to similar companies? Essentially *are we ahead or behind expectations for an organisation like ours*? This approach of determining norms and *staying within the lane* is a reasonable heuristic when entering a domain without subject matter experts within the organisation.

A useful way to determine this positioning is to consider how **mature** the organisation is across the key drivers of cybersecurity risk.  Those being:

- **People**: The behaviour and knowledge of the team 
- **Processes**: The nature of the work that the team undertakes (e.g. how complex or repeatable it is)
- **Systems**: The tools and infrastructure in place that enables them to do this work

Where the risks relate to the ability to maintain the **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** ([CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)) of their information assets. In this analysis I've defined 3 levels of progression:

#### Level 1: Basic
This doesn't mean no risk management but rather a lack of central control, formality or repeatability to solutions in place to address risks.  More weighting is placed on good luck than good planning.

#### Level 2: Improved
An authority has been identified within the organisation who has considered the assets and associated risks. Solutions may be in place that have been developed for the purpose if risk mitigation, but they may be specific to a team or function. They may also lack formality and oversight which results in variable outcomes.

#### Level 3: Best practice
This indicates that research has been done to determine the optimal solution for the organisation, it has been documented, and relevant processes are being followed for implementation and oversight. Also that the solutions in place are being reconsidered on a regular basis.

Each of the elements in the table above can represent significant amounts of effort to be progressed through and I anticipate expanding on each through this site. A framework for managing information-security risk such as **ISO 27001** essentially encompasses a toolkit to undertake that work.  Where that longer term commitment is anticipated I would recommend going down that pathway as the structure of the program is well considered and the benefit brought through external audit is clear to see.
