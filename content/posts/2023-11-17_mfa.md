What is MFA?

There are three main types of MFA factors:
Something you know: This includes passwords, PINs, and security questions.
Something you have: This includes physical tokens, such as hardware security keys, and digital tokens, such as authenticator apps.
Something you are: This includes biometrics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans.
