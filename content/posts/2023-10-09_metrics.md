## Common Business Metrics and Leading vs Lagging indicators

There are many drivers to to have clarity around the performance of a business.  Most directly they are internal for the executive, board and leadership team to be able set strategy and track performance to that. But they are also external such as compliance (e.g. regulatory oversight and accounting) or fund-raising (e.g. venture capital).  

In order to do this efficiently there are a number of standardised metrics that are used.  Where financially focused these will target either the cost side, the revenue side, or some ratio between the two.  Common examples include: 

- monthly or annual recurring revenue (MRR / ARR) 
- gross / net profit margin 
- the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC)
- the average duration it takes to "pay back" customer acquistion costs 
- revenue per employee (RPE)

These well known metrics are preferred because there are industry expectations for each and having an easy method for comparison is highly desirable for understanding performance.  These are all lagging indicators in that they are tracking historical record rather than making a prediction about the future that a leading indicator might show.  Sales pipeline metrics or customer engagement or behaviour are often used as leading indicators which would provide the opportunity to anticipate an outcome and act to influence that prior to it happening.  Leading indicators may be less reliable or open to intepretation so are inherently less trusted.  Examples of leading indicators include:

- sales pipeline coverage (multipler over budget)
- customer usage of the service
- support activity 
- percentage of business from referals 

At some point these metrics converge with the work of the accounting team where the viewpoint is focussed on OpEx/CapEx or from the cashflow statement:

-  **"above the line" costs**: required to enable revenue (e.g. COGS) 
-  **"below the line" costs**: general and administrative costs

A practical example of how this translates to a SaaS business is the desire to understand:

- the cost of product development (including related I.T. and infrastructure costs)
- the cost of delivering a single sales (the incremental cost)
- the cost of servicing a single sale (the fixed cost)

The goal outcome for knowing these metrics is an ability to forecast costs given the various scenarios of sales and or other activity (e.g. product development) within the organisation.  The outcome will be a blend of fixed costs that continue regardless of activity or variable costs that are dynamic and linked to what is happening in the business. 

## Cloud Infrastructure Cost Reporting

Examples of fixed costs in a cloud infrastructure environment would be data storage and servers (for a stable production environment) where as variable costs might be analytical work or compute for temporary or ad hoc work.  By tagging or having a methodology for putting the infrastructure costs in appropriate buckets the process of getting to these metrics can be significantly automated. 

A good starting point for this process is to identify the 'dimensions' for analysis. I've written more on dimensions [here](https://github.com/toobstar/data-tools).  These reporting dimensions would typically include:

- time: daily, weekly, monthly
- geography: state, country
- service type: perhaps related to the customer or sales categorisations
- organisation: team or business unit
- cost profile: fixed, variable (as described above)

With these dimensions sorted it's then necessary to ensure your cost drivers (such as AWS in the example I'll continue with) can be identified in the cost reporting tools. Where these are not built into standard attributes of AWS these can be set with tags (although not retrospectively of course).
