## AI Agents

Since the start of 2024 I've been hearing about AI agents revolutionising how we work and so far that has mostly been a vision of the future. An AI agent, as opposed to a chat assistant such as ChatGPT is an autonomous application that beyond answering questions will undertake an action.  These actions could be the sorts of things you do on your computer now like sending an email, processing and moving data, or browsing the web.  They could also be the sort of thing a script or an application might currently do. 

The ability to define an agent that has a focus on a specific task with a definable context, and then connect agents together to undertake more complex tasks has huge potential. This process of decomposition is familiar to any engineer and the broken down tasks become much more achievable to solve with the tools we have available now.  Given each agent has a smaller focus the ability to reuse agents as building blocks becomes even more powerful. 

## Tooling

The tools to enable the development and operation of AI Agents has quickly developed with:

- developer options such as [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- workflow tools such as [Gumloop](https://www.gumloop.com/) and (open source) [n8n](https://n8n.io/)
- operational and infrastructure management with the likes of [AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com), and (open source)
[OpenDevin](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)


## Challenges 

The constraint of much enterprise I.T. is communication and interoperability between systems. There are large ecosystems of businesses that have been active solving these challenges such as [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com).  The advantage foundational service providers have (the likes of Microsoft, SalesForce) is that they can try and solve the interoperability challenge by holding (or vacuuming up) all the data.  This is a powerful advantage which they are trying to leverage now with the likes of [Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/au/agentforce/). 


## Solving interoperability

The initial solution for this was to take a leaf out of past engineering approachs such as automating QA and have the AI Agent drive a browser and replicate (literally) the work of a human to solve the access constraint. This naive approach may work in some cases but is likely to not be desirable for service providers so is not a stable solution to consider.  Recently there has been momentum bulding behind a standard protocol for communication called [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) which was created by Anthropic.

> The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

[Recently OpenAI](https://x.com/sama/status/1904957253456941061) announced their support for MCP which has driven significant energy behind this [to become a universal standard](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/).
