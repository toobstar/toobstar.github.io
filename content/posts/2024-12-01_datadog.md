### Application Instrumentation

Refers to the process of adding monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities to an application to collect performance metrics, detect issues, and gain insights into behaviour for understanding usage or audit requirements.  

In the early days of server management the focus was on logs and whilst the number of instances was small and stable this was acceptable, but as the transition to the cloud progressed (& the volumes of logs accelerated) the suitability of a log-centric approach became less practical. 




It involves embedding code, using libraries, or employing third-party tools to track key application activities in real time.

Why Use Application Instrumentation?
Performance Monitoring – Measures response times, latency, throughput, and resource usage.
Error Detection & Debugging – Helps identify bottlenecks, failures, and exceptions.
Observability & Logging – Records key events and logs application states for troubleshooting.
User Experience Optimization – Tracks interactions and improves responsiveness.
Security Monitoring – Detects suspicious activities or anomalies.
Types of Application Instrumentation
Logging – Captures detailed logs of application events.
Metrics Collection – Gathers numerical data like CPU usage, memory consumption, request rates, etc.
Tracing – Tracks end-to-end request flow across services (useful in microservices architectures).
Profiling – Analyzes CPU, memory, and execution times of functions.
Popular Instrumentation Tools
APM (Application Performance Monitoring) Tools: New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics, Dynatrace.
Logging Frameworks: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd.
Distributed Tracing Tools: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin.




### Some history of datadog

Datadog was founded in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc.   

Origin: The idea stemmed from their own experiences working in the tech industry. They recognized the need for a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-based workflows.   
Early Days: Datadog initially focused on infrastructure monitoring, providing tools to track server performance, network traffic, and other key metrics.   
Growth and Expansion: Over time, Datadog expanded its offerings to include log management, security monitoring, and application performance monitoring.   
IPO: In 2019, Datadog went public, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory.   
Continued Innovation: Datadog continues to innovate and expand its platform, incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide more advanced insights and automation capabilities.   
Essentially, Datadog's history is one of identifying a critical need in the evolving cloud computing landscape and building a successful company around a platform that addresses that need.
