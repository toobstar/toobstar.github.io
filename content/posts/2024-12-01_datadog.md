### Some history of datadog

Usernames & passwords on computers as a model for controlling access have been around for ever (well ... since the 1960s).  In the internet era this evolved to the username just being your email which meant only one additional thing to keep track of.  But as our use of the web exploded and eventually led into more sensitive activities like e-commerce our ability to keep track of passwords quickly fell apart.  This led to common and reused passwords, which led to techniques for brute-force cracking of passwords, which led to password expiration rules, which led to password complexity rules, which led to password management applications.  

Datadog was founded in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc.   

Origin: The idea stemmed from their own experiences working in the tech industry. They recognized the need for a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-based workflows.   
Early Days: Datadog initially focused on infrastructure monitoring, providing tools to track server performance, network traffic, and other key metrics.   
Growth and Expansion: Over time, Datadog expanded its offerings to include log management, security monitoring, and application performance monitoring.   
IPO: In 2019, Datadog went public, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory.   
Continued Innovation: Datadog continues to innovate and expand its platform, incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide more advanced insights and automation capabilities.   
Essentially, Datadog's history is one of identifying a critical need in the evolving cloud computing landscape and building a successful company around a platform that addresses that need.
